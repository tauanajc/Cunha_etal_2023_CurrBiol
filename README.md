This repository contains the scripts used to assemble and analyze the genomes of two nematomorph species. The assemblies were built with ONT long reads, and Illumina whole-genome and Hi-C short reads. If you use this repository, please cite:

Below is the pipeline used for genome assembly, with reference links to software and information. Additional folders in this repository contain the final assemblies, and the R script for analyses of functional enrichment.
