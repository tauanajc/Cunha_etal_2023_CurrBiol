# Genome assembly and loss of universal genes in Nematomorpha

This repository contains the scripts used to assemble and analyze the genomes of two nematomorph species. If you use this repository, please cite:

Cunha TJ, De Medeiros BAS, Lord A, SÃ¸rensen MV, Giribet G. 2023. **Rampant loss of universal metazoan genes revealed by a chromosome-level genome assembly of the parasitic Nematomorpha**. Current Biology.

The assemblies were built with long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and with Illumina short reads from whole-genome and Hi-C libraries.
